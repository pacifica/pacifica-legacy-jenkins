How this works:

One jenkins job per SCM branch

Repoenv - A set of jobs/yum repositories with specified branches. Can override one or more job-branches, sharing the rest of the jobs.
Jobs - Jobs are targeted to be built in a single repoenv.

The idea here is to let you create parallel job sets that share most things. For example, you create two env's:
main and mdediting:

and override the branches on some of the set of things:
main is all trunk jobs
mdediting uses the trunk jobs for everything except pacifica-core branch mdediting and amalgam branch mdediting-foo
